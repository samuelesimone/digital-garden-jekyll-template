## About me

**Industrial PhD Student** @ UNIMI in ==AI & VRP==.

MSc Degree in Computer Science @ University of Milano.

BSc Degree in Computer Science @ University of Milan-Bicocca.

**Simulation**, **optimization**, **AI** and **logistics** are topics that I delve more deeply into. <br>
Also passionate about both **native** and **hybrid mobile development** through Android Studio and React Native. <br>
In addition, I have a particular focus on how technology poses to us, through the creation of **interfaces** for both **mobile apps** and **responsive websites** accessible for all. This process therefore led me to achieve the course designed by Google thus obtaining the certification of "*Google Certified UX Designer*‚Äù.
